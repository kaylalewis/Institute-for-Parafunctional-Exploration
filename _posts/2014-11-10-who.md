Members of IPE share the need to realize the absurd, incomprehensible, and impossible. If you are an artist, mother, janitor, romantic, apostle, acrobat, or anything else that shares in the same curiosity, you have found a place in IPE that will guarantee full support of your ridiculous endeavors.

<em>"Since the human race is composed entirely of pataphysicians, the College of 'Pataphysics distinguishes between those who are conscious of the fact and those who are unconscious."</em> -Alfred Jarry, Article III, Statutes governing the conduct of the College

Because your status in IPE depends on an acknowledgement of your 'pataphysical disposition, members must first be accepted into the college after a completion of a survey. Of course, there isn't one right or one wrong answer to the questions, but your answers must leave a pataphysical tone that convinces the board that you are ready to become a member.
