<h1> What we are </h1>

The Institute for Parafunctional Exploration takes the common functionality of an object or system and completely disregards it in order to reach conclusions and discoveries based off profound insight into alternative modes of perception and recognition. Whether through paradigms, fields of research, or methods of communication, IPE looks beyond conventions and the obvious and into new realms â€“ or reimagines old ones.
